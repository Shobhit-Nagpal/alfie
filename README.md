# alfie
Alfie is a discord bot made for the purpose of handling content shared in a particular server.

It uses a channel called 'content' as the database for all content to store.

The way it works is that if any server member were to send a link in a message and then use the :BOOKMARK: emoji (available within the server) as a reaction to the message, the bot will read that and send an embed into the content channel.

There's also a fun functionality to add embed to a channel called 'starboard' in case 3 or more people were to star a message.

For hosting, the bot uses Replit and Uptime Robot/Freshping.
